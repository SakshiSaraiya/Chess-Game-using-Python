# Chess-Game-using-Python
The Chess Game project is a full implementation of the iconic strategy board game, Chess, to be played in Python. The project shows real-world uses of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including class hierarchies, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also underscores fundamental programming ideas like input checking, real-time interaction, and game logic. The aim of this report is to record the project design, development, and implementation along with emphasizing the problems encountered, technical solutions adopted, and future improvements.
